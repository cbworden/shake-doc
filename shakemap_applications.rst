Applications of ShakeMap
=================================
The distribution of shaking from a significant earthquake, whether expressed as peak acceleration or intensity,
provides responding organizations a significant increment of information beyond magnitude and epicenter.
Real-time ground-shaking maps provide an immediate opportunity to assess the scope and impact of an event. 
Thus, they can allow emergency managers and responders to determine what areas were likely subjected
to the highest intensities and what the probable impacts were in those arease. Importantly, ShakeMap also allows
descision-makers a rapid portrayal of those areas that received only weak motions and are likely to be undamaged. The latter areas can be potentially used for mutual aid. 

Though initial developed primarily for emergency management, ShakeMaps have been
shown to be highly beneficial for other user sectors. Other uses include:
improved loss estimation, public information and education through the media and
web pages, financial descision-making, and engineering and seismological
research. Some specific examples are provided below for these use cases. 

As a side benefit, an intensity-based depiction of shaking hazards through
ShakeMap (and DYFI?) facilitates the adoption of the intensity scale more
generally and can thus it can be used for other risk-reduction systems and
purposes. That is, inculcating the populous to shaking using intensity scales
(as opposed to magnitude alone), has becomes crucial not just for communicating
post-earthquake shaking hazards, the color coding and utilization of intensity
has more generally helped depict imminent and future shaking hazards. For
example, the ShakeMap intensity color-palette has been adopted for Earthquake
Early Warning (EEW; see for example `QuakeAlert
<http://www.shakealert.org/faq/>`_) as well as for communicating future hazards
through deterministic scenarios and with Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Maps
(PSHA). 

Emergency Management and Response
-------------------------------------------------
ShakeMap has been recognized as a top priority for disaster management and response in the U.S.:

  "ShakeMap has become a valuable tool to assist emergency responders in identifying the likely extent of earthquake damage. Strong-motion data (now increasingly available in real-time) can be correlated with documentation and evaluation of the performance of the built environment, leading to understanding the causes of earthquake damage and the occurrence of good structural and non-structural performance" (`Western States Seismic Policy Council Policy Recommendation, 14-3, <www.wsspc.org/wp-content/.../PR_14-3_SeismicMonitoring_WebPub.pdf>`_). 

Similarly, according to a report by the `National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction* <www.sdr.gov>`_ (`Grand Challenges for Disaster Reduction: Priority Interagency Earthquake Implementation Actions <www.sdr.gov/docs/185820_Earthquake_FINAL.pdf>`_). The report describes *Grand Challenge 1*:

    "Provide hazard and disaster information where and when it is needed. [...] Expand the Advanced National Seismic System to improve seismic monitoring and deliver rapid, robust earthquake information products; For all urban areas with moderate to high seismic risk, produce ShakeMaps that show the variation of shaking intensity within minutes after an earthquake based on near real time data transmission from densely spaced seismic networks."

"The very rapid availability of earthquake source data—including magnitude,
location, depth, and fault geometry—provides basic orienting information for
emergency responders, essential information for the news media and the public,
and input data for other applications and response-relevant products. Maps of
ground shaking intensity (ShakeMap) have many important applications in
emergency management. Because ShakeMap is available via the Internet, all
emergency responders at all levels of government and the private sector have
access to the same rapidly available information. With this information,
responders can quickly assess the scope of the emergency and mobilize resources
accordingly. Early reconnaissance efforts can target areas known to have been
shaken most severely, and key emergency services including search and rescue,
emergency medical response, safety assessment of critical facilities, and
shelter and mass care can be expedited based on a more rapid identification of
incident location. Monitored information is also useful for rapidly assessing
situations in which a large, widely felt earthquake occurs but causes little
damage (such as the Hector Mine earthquake of October 16, 1999). Clearly, there
are significant economic benefits in scaling a response to the consequences of
an event, including no response for an earthquake that requires none."

"Based on ground motion data from seismic networks, HAZUS can be used to
generate estimates of economic losses, utility system damage, and population
impacts. These data provide information useful for several response and recovery
actions (discussed in the following section). For response actions, HAZUS
outputs will supplement the ground shaking information from ShakeMap by
estimating the level of damage to buildings, utilities, and transportation
infrastructure; contribute to identifying the appropriate response activation
level; provide guidance for initiating building safety assessments; help
determine the number of shelters that must be opened to house the displaced; and
provide an estimate of the amount of resources needed to care for people in
temporary housing."

Committee on the Economic Benefits of Improved Seismic Monitoring (2006). Improved Seismic Monitoring - Improved Decision-Making:
Assessing the Value of Reduced Uncertainty, National Research Council, 196 pp., DOI: 10.17226/11327

"Seismic monitoring and the products that are derived from modern
networks—including ShakeMap and HAZUS—offer significant benefits for emergency
response and recovery. The benefits of enhanced seismic monitoring include rapid
and accurate identification of the event, its location and magnitude, the extent
of strong ground shaking, and estimates of damage and population impacts. This
information expedites hazard identification, promotes rapid mobilization at
levels appropriate to the emergency, and facilitates the rapid identification of
buildings that are safe for continued occupation and those that must be
evacuated. While it may be reasonable to surmise that—in the context of the $100
billion single-event estimate—improved (in particular, more targeted) emergency
response would yield avoided costs in the range of tens of millions of dollars,
there simply is insufficient information to provide a rigorous basis for
quantitative estimate of potential benefits."

.. sidebar:: USE CASE #1

 The `California Department of Transportation <http://www.earthquakeauthority.com/‎>`_ (Caltrans) employs ShakeMap
 for post-earthquake portfolio assessments for significant California earthquakes. [TBS; REF]

One of the first examples of the use of ShakeMap for emergency management and response was the 
the M7.1 Hector Mine earthquake of October 16, 1999. This event provides an important lesson in the use of
ShakeMap to assess the scope of the event and to determine the level of mobilization necessary.
The Hector Mine earthquake produced ground-motion that was widely felt in
the Los Angeles basin and, at least in the immediate aftermath, required an assessment of potential impacts.
It was rapidly apparent, based on ShakeMap, that the Hector Mine earthquake was not a disaster and despite an
extensive area of strong ground shaking, only a few small desert settlements were affected. Thus,
mobilization of a response effort was limited to a small number of companies 
with infrastructure in the region and brief activations of emergency operations centers in
San Bernardino and Riverside Counties and the California Office of Emergency Services
(now the California Emergency Management Agency, or CalEMA), Southern Region.

Unnecessary response in an effort to fully assess the potential effects of an
earthquake, although not as costly as inadequate or misguided response in a real
disaster, can be costly as well. Had the magnitude-7 earthquake occurred in
urban Los Angeles or another urban area in California, ShakeMap could be
employed to quickly identify the communities and jurisdictions requiring
immediate response.  To help facilitate the use of ShakeMap in emergency
response, ShakeMap is now provided to organizations with critical emergency
response functions automatically through USGS web pages, ShakeCast and similar
tools.

"A catastrophic earthquake and tsunami event along the 800-mile-long Cascadia
Subduction Zone, which lies off the northwest coast of the United States,
presents a significant danger and a tremendous challenge to the State of
California and FEMA Region IX, as well as to the states of Oregon and Washington
and FEMA Region X. Earthquakes strike without warning and can forever alter
people’s lives, cripple infrastructure, and disrupt the economic and social
stability of communities."

Loss Estimation
----------------------------------------------------------

The `Federal Emergency Management Agency <http://www.fema.org/‎>`_ (FEMA) employs ShakeMap for
post-earthquake damage assessments using HAZUS-MH :ref:`FEMA \(2006\) <fema2006>` loss estimation software.
USGS generates customized formatted ESRI shapefiles for direct input into the
FEMA’s Hazards U.S. (`HAZUS-MH <http://www.fema.gov/hazus>`_ ; :ref:`FEMA
\(2006\) <fema2006>`. The customization includes: specific contour intervals for
all events, geometric mean ground motions (as opposed to ShakeMap standard
maximum component, and peak ground velocity in units of inches/sec rather than
cm/s. The HAZUS-formatted ShakeMaps are made available to FEMA for scenarios and
all significant domestic (U.S.) earthquakes and become automatically available
to FEMA via Web pages and ArcGIS services (see GIS section above). 

The use of ShakeMaps as the shaking hazard input into HAZUS is a major improvement in loss-estimation accuracy
because actual ground-motion observations are used directly to assess damage rather than relying on simpler
estimates based on epicenter and magnitude alone, or from predefined earthquake scenarios built into HAZUS software.

FEMA's HAZUS loss estimates can be important for coordinating State and Federal
response efforts as well as Disaster Declarations. HAZUS's detailed impact
reports can provide focus to the mobilization of resources and
expedite the local, State, and Federal disaster declaration process, thus
initiating the response and
recovery machinery of Government. ShakeMap, when overlaid with inventories of
critical lifelines and 
facilities (e.g., hospitals, utilities, and substations, etc.), highways and
bridges, and vulnerable structures,
provides an important means of  prioritizing response. Such response activities
can include: shelter and mass care,
mutual aid assignments, emergency management, damage and safety assessment,
utility and lifeline restoration,
and emergency public information.

   infrastructure (circles) examined. Figure courtesy of D. Bausch, FEMA.

As of 2015, the HAZUS-MH software is run interactively, not automatically, so
qualified FEMA personel must be on hand to initiate HAZUS calculations and post
the results. In addition for heavily-populated areas (major cities in
California, for example), HAZUS software typically can take a few hours to
compute losses. Thus, initial HAZUS-based losses are well behind initial
ShakeMap and PAGER results, and of course they are limited to domestic (U.S.)
earthquakes. However, the HAZUS results provide much greater detail and
information about infrastructure than PAGER-based aggregated losses. 

As described in the section on Scenarios, HAZUS-MH is the standard approach for
delivering loss estimates for ShakeMap scenarios domestically. For real events,
the USGS ShakeMap to FEMA HAZUS handoff has been formalized with a formal
liaison agreement (a Memo of Understanding, MOU) involving Doug Bausch, formerly
of FEMA Region VIII, and David Wald at the USGS NEIC. Because ShakeMap shaking
estimates evolve with time, and HAZUS loss estimates take time to compute, it is
essential that direct communications between the two agencies takes place
immediately after a serious earthquake to allow for optimizing the loss
estimates.

The USGS-FEMA partnership has been activated for several domestic earthquakes
since this system was put into place including: 2004 M6.0 Parkfield, California;
2006 Kiholo Bay, Hawaii; 2010 Virginia, 2010 M7.2 Baja California; 2011 M5.6
Oklahoma; 2011 M5.8 Virginia, and the M6.0 2015 American Canyon (South
Napa), Californa, and several other events. The same approach has been
tested and applied retrospectively against the 1994 Northridge and 1989
Loma Pieta, California, and other events.

Financial Sector Decision-Making
----------------------------------------------------------
Post-earthquake financial decision-making has evolved considerably over the past
decade. Insurers and reinsurers, private companies, governments, and aid
organizations have shown increasing creativity in the utilization of
near-real-time earthquake information for their own loss estimation, financial
adjudication, and situational awareness. Such financial analyses can be of
significant benefit to stakeholders, facilitating risk transfer operations,
fostering sensible management of risk portfolios, and assisting disaster
responders. Ultimately, these improvements translate to benefits for the public
and those at risk (:ref:`Franco, 2015 <franco2015>`).

In general, there are three categories of post-earthquake financial services and
decision-making: 1) analysis of expected losses arising from an actual event
against a portfolio of exposures, 2) the triggering of payments for parametric
insurance products, and 3) the use of quantitative loss estimates to manage
disaster response and aid. Business and public sector portfolio managers can
employ tools like ShakeCast or in-house applications to automatically retrieve
and compute losses based on pre-assigned fragility curves. Within the
(re)insurance sector, catastrophe (CAT) bonds and contingency loans based on
earthquake risk models are often triggered via parametric analyses which are
dependent on earthquake parameters or intensity-measure (IM) estimates as well
as their uncertainties. Anticipating potential losses and acting rapidly and
accordingly is also of utmost importance to emergency management and disaster
aid communities. Estimated losses constitute vital input for rapid situational
awareness, facilitating decision-making on whether or not to commit and deploy
resources, and to what level.

.. sidebar:: USE CASE #5
	     
  The Inter-American Development Bank `<http://www.iadb.org>`_ (IADB) employs ShakeMap for objective post-earthquake assessments for within 72 hours of  any significant earthquake in Latin America and the Caribbean (LACR). IADB's Contingent Credit Facility Loans has set up disaster contingency loans for up to several hundred million USD, conditional on predefined levels of population exposed to ShakeMap intensity VI and higher. Typically, loans can be distributed when the population over intensity VI reaches at least 2% of the population within the coverage area. Loans are available in six LACR countries during the period of availability (J. Martinez, IADB, written communication, 2014).

To a large extent, the advancement of post-earthquake financial instruments has
been facilitated by the availability of rapid and accurate earthquake parameters
and more quantitative geospatial hazard information. Commensurately, USGS
products like ShakeMap and PAGER have evolved to further accommodate specific
requirements of the financial sector. For instance, improved approaches for
quantifying uncertainty can better inform loss estimates and historical ShakeMap
Atlas data can assist in loss model calibration. In addition, USGS now provides
PAGER loss estimates broken down by country to fulfill the need required in the
CAT bond and contingency loan arena, while still remaining within the confines
of reasonable spatial accuracy. Similarly, requests have been made by U.S. State
governments to further compute losses at the state level, although such
resolution is not yet warranted, particularly in areas of sparse real-time
strong-motion instrumentation. Lastly, for many uses, the automatic retrieval
and processing of ShakeMaps has been facilitated via GeoJSON feeds, web-mapping
servers, and the ShakeCast systems. 

Several types of data and information products available or under development
that may be of benefit to the financial sector. The generation of suites of
standardized earthquake scenarios–both domestic and internationally–is underway,
and an update of the global Atlas of ShakeMaps has been completed (see
:ref:`sec_shakemap-archives`). 

There are several continuing challenges that are actively under consideration
and scrutiny: implementing directivity, computing and depicting spatial ground
motion correlations, improved approaches for quantifying and conveying
uncertainties, and a more explicit ShakeMap policy and version control
documentation. :ref:`Wald and Franco \(2016\) <wald2016>` describe how these
advances may in turn facilitate the appearance of new and more refined financial
instruments.
 
Public Information and Education
---------------------------------------------
The rapid availability of ShakeMap on the Internet combined with the urgent
desire for information following a significant earthquake makes this mapping
tool a huge potential source of public information and education. In instances
in which an earthquake receives significant news coverage, the ShakeMap site as
well as the “Did You Feel It?” (DYFI) system receives an enormous increase in
web site visitors (:ref:`Wald et al., 2011 <wald2011c>`). Such opportunities are
amplified by widespread adoption of ShakeMap into media and educational
materials by other institutions. 

ShakeMap's intensity scale is key for introducing and inculcating the public and
the media to the importance of macroseismic intensity rather than the continuing
sole dependence on magnitude as the scale of reference for earthquakes. Although
Japanese Meterological Agency (JMA) Intensity (.e.g., :ref:`JMA, 1996
<jma1996>`) differs slightly from its U.S. MMI counterpart---JMA's is strictly
instrumentally-derived---it is widely used and understood in Japan (e.g.,
:ref:`Celsi et al., 2005 <celsi2005>`). JMA has successfully made intensity the
norm for communicating to the Japanese population about real-time and future
earthquake hazards via television, smartphone, Web content, annual earthquake
drills, and the educational system. Because JMA intensity is widely understood,
public is be more attuned to earthquake risks than populations familiar only
with magnitude descriptions of earthquakes (e.g., :ref:`Celsi et al., 2005
<celsi2005>`). 

"Earthquake education also occurs through the media. The anchoring effect we
report may be lessened signiﬁcantly if the press consistently used the Mercalli
scale and helped to educate the public about the scale. Research should be
conducted to better understand if and how news organizations can successfully
utilize the Mercalli scale in communicating earthquake information. Alternative
formats, for example, using letters rather than Roman numerals for the
categories, may ameliorate the confusion between magnitude and Mercalli scales.
The experience in Japan provides support for the idea that laypeople can learn
to use the two scales side by side. The Japanese media report both intensities
and magnitude, with viewers maintaining a clearer understanding of the
relationship between magnitude and intensity. In Japan, the overall magnitude
and the intensity are both instrument numbers, with the latter being
location-specific."

The inculcation of the public to intensity is inline with the findings of
:ref:`Gomberg and Jokobitz \(2013\) <gomberg2013>` "Simpler messaging and
explanations are needed by some users,
and this may be achieved by developing two styles of some products, one designed
for nontechnical users and the other tailored for engineers and scientists. The
tangible impacts of an earthquake must be conveyed more simply and succinctly,
employing a scale useful for decision-making at the regional and local levels."

Acknowledging the importance of ShakeMap as a tool for public information and
education, considerable effort was taken to provide the range of formats
suitable for broadcast and Web pages. Initially, Media Maps, simplified versions
of the Instrumental Intensity maps were packaged in a way that makes them more
suitable for broadcast
to low-resolution devices, such as TV monitors: roads and borders are thicker;
fonts are
larger; and the title and intensity scale are simplified, and "TV guide"
information sheet intended to supplement the Media Maps was provided to allow
easier delivery of basic earthquake information. These formats have naturally
evolved to GIS, KML, and now interactive (zoomable) maps that allow
customization of the basemap layers and other content.

However, some of the static maps have made for the most widespread distribution.
A very widely used graphic (:num:`Figure #northridge-nisqually`), for example,
compares ShakeMap-generated intensities for the 1994 Northridge earthquake, a
shallow crustal earthquake near Los Angeles, with the 2001, deep, intraslab
Nisqually, WA, earthquake. This figure was reprinted in numerous reports,
textbooks, classes, reports, and briefings including `Putting Down Roots
<http://www.earthquakecountry.org/roots/shaking.html>`_ and the :ref:`National
Research Council <NRC2006>`, for example.

   Widely adopted graphic of comparing ShakeMaps for the 2001 Nisqually, WA (M6.8), and 1994 Northridge, CA (M6.7) earthquakes showing how distance from an earthquake affects the level of shaking experienced. Even though the magnitude of the Nisqually earthquake was slightly larger than the Northridge earthquake, the shaking was lower on average primarily because the fault that ruptured during the Northridge earthquake was shallower (5-20 km deep) than that for the Nisqually earthquake (about 45-50 km deep).

The continued long-term education of the populous to intensity continues through many TV and other channels,
for instance, in education (e.g., `Larry Braile's undergraduate courses <http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/edumod/eqhazard/eqhazard2.htm>`_), textbooks (e.g., :ref:`Yeats, 2004 <yeats2004>`
"Living with Earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest"),
and `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Nisqually_earthquake>`_.

Earthquake Engineering and Seismological Research
-----------------------------------------------------

For potentially damaging earthquakes, ShakeMap also produces response spectral
acceleration values at three periods
(0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 s) for use not only in loss estimation as mentioned above,
but these IMs also serve many earthquake engineering analysis purposes. In a
post-earthquake environment, information from engineering analyses of structures
(including via ShakeCast, see below) provides a framework for post-earthquake
occupancy and damage inspection by civil engineers.

In addition to providing information on recent events, ShakeMap Web pages
provide maps and aggregate shaking intensity measures (IMs) for numerous
earthquakes, both for recent events (Archives)as well has historic and events
(Atlas).
In the long term---in conjunction with reported macroseismic data or specific
damage observations---the parametric IMs provide the basis for analyses of
ground motion observations and human behavior as well as response by both the
natural and built environments. What follows is a short survey of several recent
studies related to these data.  

[TBS] 

.. Engineers have found these maps helpful in evaluating the maximum and cumulative effects of seismic loading
   for the life of any particular structure. This is particularly relevant given the discovery of the potential damage
   to column/beam welds in steel buildings following the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

.. In seismological research, ShakeMap has been proven particularly effective in gaining a quick overview of
   the effects of geological structure and earthquake rupture processes on the nature of recorded ground-motions.
   ShakeMaps showing the distribution of recorded peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV)
   overlain on regional topography maps allow scientists to gauge the effects of local site amplification because
   topography is a simple proxy for rock versus deep-basin soil-site conditions.  This can lead to more detailed
   investigations into the nature of the controlling factors in generating localized regions of damaging
   ground-motions.

ShakeMap is also a source frequently used by scientists developing Ground Motion
Prediction Equations (GMPEs), Ground Motion/Intensity Conversation Equations
(GMICEs), and other studies where accumulated peak ground motion data are
useful.
