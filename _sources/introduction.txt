   Napa, California, earthquake intensity ShakeMap
`ShakeMap <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/shakemap/>`_ ®, 
developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, facilitates communication of 
earthquake information beyond just magnitude and location. By rapidly mapping out 
earthquake ground motions, ShakeMap portrays the distribution and severity of shaking, 
information critical for gauging the extent of the areas affected, determining which areas 
are potentially hardest hit, and allowing for rapid estimation of losses. Key to 
ShakeMap's success, algorithms were developed that take advantage of any high-quality 
recorded ground motions, and any available macroseismic intensity data, to provide 
ground-truth constraints on shaking. Yet, ShakeMap also utilizes best-practice methods 
for both interpolating between recordings—and critically—providing estimates of 
shaking in areas where observations are sparse or non-existent. Thus, ShakeMap portrays 
the best possible description of shaking by employing a combination of recorded and 
estimated shaking values. 

The ShakeMap Manual (2015), a significant update [#]_ of the original (Wald et al., 2005) 
ShakeMap Manual. The ShakeMap manual is now dynamic and served online. We demote the notion of a static, 
stand-alone document in favor up-to-date web pages. The Manual provides background on technical aspects of ShakeMap, describes 
the wide range of products and formats ShakeMap produces, and provides guidance for 
ShakeMap developers and operators. Readers interested in understanding how 
ShakeMaps works can skip to Section 1: Technical Background. Those who want to use 
ShakeMap products and understand their varied formats can jump to Section 2: User's 
Guide. If your goal is to install and operate ShakeMap, see Section 3: Implementation 
Guide. Section 3 also points users to the ShakeMap software distribution and Software 
Guide. 

.. [#] Such a map is not strictly necessary: It can be produced “on the fly” by ShakeMap using a regional or global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and slope-based topography (e.g., Wald and Allen, 2007). Nevertheless most regions will want more control over the site map, and will opt for a fixed Vs30 map.
