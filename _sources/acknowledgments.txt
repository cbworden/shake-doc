Many contributions in a variety of forms have greatly helped in the development, implementation, and use of ShakeMap. ShakeMap is typical just one important end product of a very sophisticated seismic network. Credit is given to all involved with the regional and national networks in the United States working under the auspices of the USGS Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).

Much of the early conceptual development of ShakeMap benefited greatly from discussions with Professors Kanamori and Heaton at Caltech.  Both the TriNet Steering and Advisory Committees also provided ongoing oversight and feedback in the early years of TriNet.  Discussions with many colleagues, including W. Savage, K. Campbell, R. Nigbor, and M. Petersen, provided additional guidance.  Early trips to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), and in particular discussions with Keiji Doi, were very helpful. 

Early ShakeMap web pages survived substantial traffic spikes due to the ingenuity and vigilance of Stan Schwarz (USGS, Pasadena). Aesthetic improvements and integration of the ShakeMap Web pages into the USGS Earthquake Hazards Team Web Page standard templates were guided by Lisa Wald (USGS, Golden). Craig Scrivner, then at the California Department of Mines and Geology (CDMG), contributed greatly to the initial ShakeMap software development. 

At regional network centers, Kris Pankow (University of Utah), Steve Malone (University of Washington), Kuo-wan Lin (formerly CGS, now USGS, Golden), Douglas Dreger, Peter Lombard (U.C. Berkeley), and Lind Gee (formerly U.C. Berkeley, now USGS, Albuquerque), Glenn Biasi (University of Nevada, Reno), and Howard Bundock (ret.), Tim MacDonald, David Oppenheimer, and Jack Boatwright (USGS, Menlo Park) all played a critical role in system testing, providing feedback, and improving the ShakeMap software.  In addition, a number of other people assisted the above colleagues in the regional ShakeMap implementation and operation.  Ned Field at the USGS in Pasadena has been very helpful in software calibration and validation and overall advice. 

In interfacing with HAZUS with we wish to thank Douglas Huls, Dave Kehrlein, and Lisa Christiansen of the California Office of Emergency Services, Jawhar Bouabid at Durham Technology, and Charles Kircher of Charlie Kircher Assoc.  

We received extremely important feedback regarding the user interface from participants through a number of meetings and workshops in California for scientific and engineering perspectives, as well as for a very wide variety of users’ perspectives.  These workshops were organized by James Goltz and Margaret Vinci.  In addition, ongoing feedback has always been abundant and provides critical advice and ideas that seeds ongoing, iterative improvements to the ShakeMap system.

Over the years, numerous students contributed greatly to the operation, development, user support and many other aspects of ShakeMap. The students include undergraduates, Chloe Gustafson, Paul Geimer, Alicia Hotovec, Kendra Johnson, Rebecca Johnson, Russell Mah, Tanya Slota, graduate students Lily Seidman, and post-doctoral residents Trevor Allen and Daniel Garcia.

International collaborators include Alberto Michelini, and Licia Faenca (INGV, Rome). ShakeMap Workshops help at U.C. Berkeley and at the Erice, Sicily, Summer School were very helpful in improving ShakeMap implementations around the country and around the world.

USGS colleagues Vincent Quitoriano and Kuo-Wan Lin have long operated, supported, and greatly added to the development of ShakeMap. Mike Hearne and Kristin Marano of the PAGER team have also provided support for ShakeMap. 

Most of all, we are also extremely grateful for the recognition of the importance of ShakeMap and the ongoing internal and external support for its development at all levels within the U.S. Geological Survey.  The support of John Filson, David Applegate, William Leith, Harley Benz, and Woody Savage, Jill McCarthy, and many others has been critical.  

ShakeMap relies extensively on the Generic Mapping Tools (Wessel and Smith, 1995).
