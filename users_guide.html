<p>ShakeMap originated primarily as an internet-based system for real-time display.
Although the online color-coded intensity maps are the most visible result of
ShakeMap system and constitute the most commonly accessed and downloaded
product, they are just one representation of the ShakeMap output. ShakeMap also
produces grids of peak ground acceleration and velocity amplitudes, peak
spectral response values, instrumental intensities, seismic station files, fault
files, metadata, regression plots, contours, metadata, and uncertainty
estimates. The ShakeMap web pages also serve a variety of formats including:
PDF, KML, XML, GeoJSON, HAZUS-MH,  GIS files, ESRI Raster, and a host of other
formats and products for the varied user needs and applications.</p>
<p>In this User&#8217;s Guide, after some background, we present the range ShakeMap
products and describe the available formats. The different automated mechanisms
to receive and utilize ShakeMap, including GIS Web Services and GeoJSON feeds,
and via ShakeCast are described and links to these are provided. Many users also
take advantage of real-time ShakeMaps, as well as older events and earthquake
planning scenarios, so we describe the three primary ShakeMap repositories:
Earthquake Real-time, historic ShakeMap Atlas events, and a collection of
Scenario ShakeMaps.</p>
<p>Next is an overview of the current ShakeMap users and applications. Beyond
quickly assessing the overall domain of shaking, ShakeMap is used across many
sectors: planning and response, loss estimation, financial services, education
and outreach, and engineering and seismological research. We provide examples of
each. The section that follows expands on how ShakeMap integrates with related
systems of DYFI, ShakeCast and PAGER. Lastly, and importantly, <strong>Disclaimers</strong>
that users should be aware of and refer to when employing ShakeMap for
decision-making.</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Until the development of ShakeMap, the most common information available
immediately following a significant earthquake was typically its magnitude and
epicenter.  However, the damage pattern is not a simple function of these two
parameters alone, and more detailed information must be provided to properly
ascertain the situation.  For example, for the magnitude-6.7 February 9, 1971,
California earthquake, the northern San Fernando Valley was the region with the
most damage, even though it was more than 15 km from the epicenter.  Likewise,
areas strongly affected by the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge, California,
earthquakes (magnitudes 6.9 and 6.7, respectively) that were either distant from
the epicentral region or out of the immediate media limelight were not fully
appreciated until long after the initial reports of damage. The full extent of
damage from the magnitude-6.9 1995 Kobe, Japan, earthquake was not recognized by
the central government in Tokyo until many hours later (e.g., Yamakawa, 1997),
seriously delaying rescue and recovery efforts.</p>
<p>A ShakeMap is a representation of ground shaking produced by an earthquake. The
information it presents is different from the earthquake magnitude and epicenter
that are released after an earthquake because ShakeMap focuses on the
ground-shaking produced by the earthquake, rather than the parameters describing
the earthquake starting point (its hypocenter) and size (magnitude). So,
although an earthquake has one magnitude and one epicenter, it produces a range
of ground shaking levels at sites throughout the region, depending on distance
from the earthquake fault that ruptured, the rock and soil conditions at sites,
and variations in the propagation of seismic waves from the earthquake due to
complexities in the structure of the Earth&#8217;s crust.</p>
<p>Part of the strategy for generating rapid-response ground-motion maps was to
determine the best format for reliable presentation of the maps given the
diverse audience, which includes scientists, businesses, emergency response
agencies, media, and the general public.  In an effort to simplify and maximize
the flow of information to the public, we have developed a means of generating
not only peak ground acceleration and velocity maps, but also an
instrumentally-derived, estimated Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) map.  This
“instrumental intensity” map makes it easier to relate the recorded
ground-motions to the expected felt and damage distribution. At the same time,
we preserve a full range of utilities of recorded ground-motion data by
producing maps of response spectral acceleration, which are not particularly
useful to the general public, but which provide fundamental data for loss
estimation and earthquake engineering assessments.</p>
<p>ShakeMap provides maps of <strong>peak</strong> ground-acceleration, velocity and spectral
acceleration maps as well as Modified Mercalli Intensity. Intensity ShakeMaps
depict estimated intensities derived from peak ground motions as well as
(optionally) from reported intensities. Intensity maps make it easier to relate
the recorded and estimated ground motions to the expected felt and damage
distributions. Estimating intensities from ground shaking is based on analyses
of intensities reported near recorded seismic stations for past earthquakes. The
legend on the ShakeMap indicates which relationship was used to estimate
intensities from ground motions, and vice versa (see the ShakeMap
<a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#technical-guide"><span>Technical Guide</span></a>).</p>
<p>Station locations are the best indicator of where the map is most accurate: Near
seismic stations the shaking is well constrained by data; far from such
stations, the shaking is estimated using standard seismological inferences and
geospatial interpolation. Details about the interpolation, uncertainty maps, and
codes for the seismic station components, network contributors, and potential
outlier or clipped flag codes are provided in the <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#technical-guide"><span>Technical Guide</span></a>. Peak
horizontal acceleration and spectral acceleration values are in units of
percent-g (where g = acceleration due to the force of gravity = 981 cm/s/s). The
peak values of the vertical components are not used in the construction of the
maps. Peak velocity values are given (in cm/sec) at each station. Acceleration
spectra are the response of a 5% critically damped, single-degree-of-freedom
oscillator to the recorded ground motion at three reference periods: 0.3, 1.0,
and 3.0 seconds.</p>

<h2>Products and Formats<a class="headerlink" href="#products-and-formats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ShakeMap is fundamentally a geographic product: the spatial representation of
the potentially very complex shaking associated with an earthquake. Because of
its complicated nature, we are required to generate numerous maps that portray
various aspects of the shaking that are customized for specific uses or
audiences.  For some uses, it is not the maps but the components that make up
the ShakeMaps that are of interest in order to recreate or further customize the
maps.  In this section we further describe these ShakeMap component products and
the variety of maps and formats.</p>
<div class="section" id="input-files">
<h3>Input Files<a class="headerlink" href="#input-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The downloadable products include sufficient information to reproduce the
ShakeMap. In particular, stationlist.xml and the fault .txt file(s) provide the
input files, <em>grid.xml</em> provides the Vs30 grid (see above), and <em>info.xml</em>
provides the important configuration and processing parameters [including the
name(s) of the fault file(s)].</p>
<p><em>Station Lists</em>. The file stationlist.xml contains the combined input data from
all of the original processing center’s input files in a ShakeMap-readable
format. The file may contain seismic station data, intensity data, or a
combination of both. The file also contains an event tag with the earthquake
source specifications. [Note: At this time it is necessary to copy the event tag
and place it in a file <em>event.xml</em> in the event’s input directory for ShakeMap
to process the event normally. We hope to remove this requirement in a future
release.] See the ShakeMap <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#software-guide"><span>Software &amp; Implementation Guide</span></a> for a complete specification of
the ShakeMap input XML formats.</p>
<p>For reasons of backward compatibility we also provide <em>stationlist.txt</em>. As with
grid.xyz the use of this file is deprecated and it may disappear in a future
release.</p>
<p><em>Fault Files</em>. Fault files are named <em>&lt;something&gt;_fault.txt</em> and are listed in
<em>info.xml</em>. Zero or more fault files may be present in the ShakeMap input
directory. See the ShakeMap <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#software-guide"><span>Software &amp; Implementation Guide</span></a> for a complete specification
of the fault file format. For the purposes of reproducing the ShakeMap for an
earthquake, it is sufficient to copy the specified file(s) into the event’s
input directory.</p>

<h4>Metadata and Runtime Information<a class="headerlink" href="#metadata-and-runtime-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>Metadata</strong>. FGDC-compliant geospatial metadata files are distributed via the
earthquake-specific ShakeMap Web page for each earthquake under the <em>Download</em>
page. The metadata are provided in text, HTML, and XML formats in the files
<em>metadata.txt</em>, <em>metadata.html</em>, and <em>metadata.xml</em>, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Supplemental Information</strong>. A second aggregation of important
earthquake-specific ShakeMap information is provided online in the file
<em>info.xml</em>. This supplemental information provides a machine-readable (XML)
rundown of many important ShakeMap processing parameters. It includes
information about the data and fault input files, the source mechanism, the
GMPE, IPE, and GMICE selected, the type and source of the site amplifications,
the map boundaries, and important output information including the bias and
maximum amplitude for each parameter. The <em>info.xml</em> is critical for
understanding or replicated any particular specific ShakeMap.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><strong>Timestamps, versions of the ShakeMap software employed, event-specific parameters, and the version of the specific ShakeMap run</strong> are documented in the supplemental information provided in the <em>info.xml</em> file.</p>

<p>Because the grid is the fundamental derived product from the ShakeMap
processing, it is fully described in an accompanying metadata file following
Federal Geographic Data Committee (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fgdc.gov/">FGDC</a>) standards
for geospatial information.  As described below, station amplitudes are provided
in separate ShakeMap station files, yet the metadata for the parametric data are
archived by the regional seismic networks and contributing strong motion data
sources.</p>

<h4>Static Maps and Plots (Images)<a class="headerlink" href="#static-maps-and-plots-images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>ShakeMap generates a number of static ground-motion maps and plots for various
parameters (ground motion metrics, or IM&#8217;s). Most of these maps are available in
JPEG format, as well as zipped PostScript files which&#8212;as vector-based
images&#8212;are suitable for PDF conversion or editing. These maps are typically
generated automatically limiting the format, extent and features that can be
depicted. Nonetheless, these static maps are ShakeMap &#8220;signature products&#8221; and
serve as maps of record and for other purposes, as described below. Static maps
can be accessed and selected tabs along the top of the USGS earthquake event
page as shown in the example in .</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Intensity maps</strong>. Intensity images&#8212;typically of Modified Mercalli Intensity
(MMI), but potentially other intensity measures&#8212;are the most familiar ShakeMap
products. The main intensity map consists of a colored overlay of intensity with
the epicenter (and the causative fault, if supplied) prominently marked,
(usually) overlain upon the region’s topography, with other cultural and
geologic features (cities, roads, and active faults) plotted, depending on the
configuration of the ShakeMap system. A detailed scale of intensity is also
provided as previously described in detail (see <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#technical-guide"><span>Technical Guide</span></a>)</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><strong>ShakeMap Symbology</strong>. It is ShakeMap convention to depict seismic stations as <strong>triangles</strong> and intensity observations as <strong>circles</strong> (for cities) or <strong>squares</strong> (for geocoded boxes). On intensity maps, symbols are see-thru so that the underlying intensity values are visible. On peak ground motion maps observations are (optionally) color-coded to their amplitude according to the legend shown below each map. The epicenter is indicated with a <strong>star</strong>, and for larger earthquakes the surface projection of the causative fault is shown with <strong>black lines</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>Strong motion and intensity data symbols default to &#8220;see thru&#8221; mode for the
intensity map shown in  and are color filled
for peak ground motion maps . ShakeMap operators may
chose to modify these defaults using alternative mapping configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Peak Ground Motion Maps.</strong> ShakeMap generates static maps for PGA, PGV and
Intensity&#8212;and optionally&#8212;three separate maps for peak spectral accelerations
(0.3, 1.0, 3.0 sec periods). The peak ground motions are distinct from intensity
maps: shaking values on the former are colored image overlays; the latter are
peak ground motion contours. On peak ground motion maps station fill colors
indicate the ground motion of the station converted to intensity or, optionally,
the identity of the seismic network data source. When the color indicates peak
ground motion, the values are converted to the intensity color scheme via the
selected ground motion intensity conversion equation (GMICE), and the
corresponding color scale bar is provided at the bottom of the map (see example
in :num: <cite>Figure #Napa.PGA</cite>).</p>

<h4>Interactive Maps<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive-maps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Although the static ShakeMaps useful, many of these products are more suitably
served as interactive maps which can be dynamic scaled (zoomed) and layered upon
with user-selected background and other overlays. The layers are provided via
GeoJSON, KML, GIS, Raster, and other formats. The USGS Earthquake Program Web
pages employ <a class="reference external" href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, an open-source JavaScript
library that suitable for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Many of the
interactive features are geared towards balancing the experience for both
desktop as well as mobile visitors. Since the interactive maps are zoomable, it
is convenient to select (&#8220;clicking&#8221;) individual stations to query station
information and amplitudes (see the example in Figure 3).</p>

<p><strong>Uncertainty Maps</strong>. As discussed in detail in the <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#technical-guide"><span>Technical Guide</span></a>,
gridded uncertainty is available for all ground motion parameters, as well as
the ratio of the ShakeMap PGA uncertainty to the GMPE’s uncertainty (see the
section on <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#sec-interpolation"><span>Interpolation</span></a>).</p>
<p>We utilize the uncertainty ratio to produce a graded map of uncertainty. Where
the ratio is 1.0 (meaning the ShakeMap is purely predictive), the map is colored
white. Where the ratio is greater than 1.0 (meaning that the ShakeMap
uncertainty is high because of unknown fault geometry) the map shades toward
dark red, and where the uncertainty is less than 1.0 (because the presence of
data decreases the uncertainty) the map shades toward dark blue. These maps
provide a quick visual summary of quality of the ground motion estimates over
the area of interest.</p>
<p>ShakeMaps are also given a letter grade, based on the mean uncertainty ratio
within the area of the MMI 6 contour (on the theory that this is the area most
important to accurately represent). A ratio of 1.0 is given a grade of “C.” Maps
with mean ratios greater than 1.0 get grades of “D” or “F.” Ratios less than 1.0
earn grades of “B” or “A.” If the map does not contain areas of MMI ≥ 6, no
grade is assigned. See the example map below.</p>

<p>As described in the Technical Manual, the fundamental output product of the
ShakeMap processing system is a finely sampled grid of latitude and longitude
pairs with associated amplitude values of shaking parameters at each point.
These amplitude values are derived by interpolation of a combination of the
recorded ground shaking observation and estimated amplitudes, with consideration
of site amplification at all interpolated points.  The resulting grid of
amplitude values provides the basis for generating color-coded intensity contour
maps, for further interpolation to infer shaking at selected locations, and for
generating GIS-formatted files for further analyses.</p>
<p><strong>XML Grid</strong>. The ShakeMap XML grid file is the basis for nearly all ShakeMap
products, as well as for computerized post-processing in systems such as
ShakeCast and PAGER [see <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-related-systems"><span>Related Systems</span></a>]. The XML grid is available
as both plain text (<em>grid.xml</em>) and compressed as a zip file (<em>grid.xml.zip</em>).</p>
<p>As XML, the grid is meant to be self-describing, however we describe the format
here for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>ShakeMap processing does not occur in a Geographic Information System (GIS), but
we post-process the grid file (above) into raster and shape files for direct
import into GIS. The file base names in each archive are abbreviations of the
type of ground-motion parameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mi    =  macroseismic intensity (usually, but not necessarily, mmi)
pga   =  peak ground acceleration
pgv   =  peak ground velocity
psa03 =  0.3 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
psa10 =  1.0 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
psa30 =  3.0 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The sub-sections that follow describe available file and product types.</p>
<p><em>Shapefiles</em>. GIS shape files are comprised of four or five standard associated GIS files:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>.dbf = A DBase file with layer attributes
.shp = The file with geographic coordinates
.shx = An index file
.prj = A file containing projection information
.lyr = A file containing presentation properties (only available for PGA, PGV, and MMI)
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In this application, the shape files are contour polygons of the peak
ground-motion amplitudes in <em>ArcView</em> shape files. These contour polygons are
actually equal-valued donut-like polygons that sample the contour map at fine
enough intervals to accurately represent the surface function. We generate the
shape files independent of a GIS using a shareware package (<em>shapelib.c</em>).
Contouring, as well as polygon formation and nesting, is performed by a program
written in <em>C</em> by Bruce Worden, and included in the ShakeMap software
distribution.</p>
<p><strong>GIS Shapefiles</strong>. Contour polygons for the peak ground-motion parameters are
also available as shape files intended for use with any GIS software that can
read ArcView shape files.  Note, however, that the peak ground velocity (PGV)
contours are in cm/s, and are therefore NOT suitable for HAZUS input.</p>
<p>The contour intervals are 0.04g for peak ground acceleration (PGA) and the three
spectral-acceleration parameters, and 2 cm/s for PGV. The file also includes MMI
contour polygons in intervals of 0.2 intensity units.  These shape files have
the same units as the online ShakeMaps.</p>
<p>The archive of files (three files for each of the mapped parameters) is
compressed in Zip format, and called <em>shape.zip</em>.  The shape.zip file is
available for all events, but the spectral values are generally only included
for earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 and larger.</p>
<p><strong>ESRI Raster Files (.fit files)</strong>. ESRI raster grids of the ground-motion
parameters and their uncertainties are also available. The files are found in a
Zipped archive called <em>raster.zip</em>. Each archive contains four files per
parameter: <em>&lt;param&gt;.fit</em> and <em>&lt;param&gt;.hdr</em>, which contain the ground-motion
data, and <em>&lt;param&gt;_std.fit</em> and <em>&lt;param&gt;_std.hdr</em>, which contain the
uncertainties for the ground motions. See <em>grid.xml</em> for information on units.
As with the other GIS files, PGA, PGV and MMI are available for all events,
while the spectral-acceleration parameters are usually included for earthquakes
M4.5 and larger.</p>
<p>This page lists all of the individual files from each of the products we use to
convey information about an earthquake.  A &#8220;product&#8221;, in this context, is
something like ShakeMap, PAGER, or Did You Feel It (DYFI), each of which
contains various maps, graphs, and data files in various formats. ShakeMap
products have the most geospatial data.  For GIS users, the two files you might
be the most interested in are the GIS Files and the ESRI Raster Files For FEMA’s
HAZUS users, the appropriate files are zipped together in the <em>hazus.zip</em> file.</p>
<p>The GIS Files (zipped) are a collection of shapefiles of contours of the
ShakeMap model outputs for each shaking metric: MMI, PGA, PGV, and PSA at three
periods.  These vectors should be easily importable into a GIS. The ESRI Raster
Files (also zipped) are a collection of ESRI formatted binary files.  It should
be relatively easy to convert these to (for example) ArcGIS GRIDS using the
standard tools provided with the software. The contours are useful primarily for
overlaying with other data for visualization purposes.  If you plan to do
analysis, where you need to know the MMI value at a particular point(s), then we
would suggest using the raster data.</p>

<p><strong>HAZUS’99 Shape Files and HAZUS-MH Geodatabases</strong>. We generate shape files that
are designed with contour polygons intervals that are appropriate for use with
the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fema.gov/hazus/">HAZUS-MH®</a> software, though they may be imported into any
GIS package that can read ArcView shape files.  Because HAZUS software requires
peak ground velocity (PGV) in inches/sec, this file may not be suitable for all
applications.  The contour intervals are 0.04g for PGA and the two spectral
acceleration parameters (HAZUS only uses the 0.3 and 1. s periods), and 4
inches/sec for PGV.</p>
<p>HAZUS’99 users can use the hazus.zip shape files (see below) directly.  However,
the 2004 release of HAZUS-MH uses geodatabases, not shapefiles.  As of this
writing, FEMA has a temporary fix in the form of Visual Basic script that
imports ShakeMap shape files and exports geodatabases.  FEMA has plans to
incorporate such a tool directly into HAZUS-MH in the next official release (D.
Baush, FEMA, Region VIII, oral commun., 2015).</p>
<p>HAZUS traditionally used the epicenter and magnitude of an earthquake as
reported, and used empirical relationships to estimate ground-motions over the
affected area.  These simplified ground estimates would drive the computation of
losses to structures and infrastructure, estimates of casualties and displaced
households (for more details, see Kircher et al., 1997; FEMA, 1997).  With the
improvements to seismic systems nationally, particularly in digital
strong-motion data acquisition, and the advent of ShakeMap, HAZUS now can
directly import a much more accurate description of ground shaking.  The
improved accuracy of the input to loss-estimation routines can dramatically
reduce the uncertainty in loss estimation due to poorly constrained shaking
approximations.</p>
<p>The HAZUS GIS files are only generated for events that are larger than
(typically) magnitude 4.5.  The set of shapefiles for these parameters is an
archive of files (three files for each of the mapped parameters) compressed in
Zip format (<em>hazus.zip</em>) to facilitate file transfer.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">An important note on the values of the parameters in the HAZUS shape files is that they are empirically corrected from the standard ShakeMap <strong>peak ground-motion values</strong> to approximate the <strong>geometric mean</strong> values used for HAZUS loss estimation.  HAZUS was calibrated to work with mean ground-motion values (FEMA, 1997). Peak amplitudes are corrected by scaling values down by 15 percent (Campbell, 1997; Joyner, oral commun., 2000). As of this writing FEMA is considering switching to peak ground motions as presented by ShakeMap rather than employing the geometric mean component.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Google Earth Overlay</strong>. The file <em>&lt;event_id&gt;.kml</em> enables the user to view the
ShakeMap within Google Earth (or other KML-compliant application). A
color-scaled intensity overlay is provided along with a complete station list,
contours of intensity and peak ground motion, a fault representation (if
provided), epicenter indicator, intensity scale, and a USGS logo. The
transparency of the intensity overlay is adjustable by the user, as is the
appearance of seismic stations. The KML file automatically links to several
other files in the event’s download directory:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>epicenter.kmz
fault.kmz
overlay.kmz (links to ii_overlay.png)

</div></blockquote>
<p>These files are loaded as network links with reasonable timeouts so the user can
expect them to update as new versions of the event’s ShakeMap are produced and
updated.</p>
<p>In addition to the ShakeMap produced KML file, the USGS produces a KML file
(linked near the top of the page in the event-centric pages with the title
“Google Earth KML”) which contains not only ShakeMap data, but also data from
PAGER, Did You Feel It?, and other sources. This file should be the preferred
source, as it will have the most up to date links.</p>
<p><strong>Contour Files</strong>. As mentioned above in the ShakeMap Output GIS format section,

<h3>Real-time ShakeMaps<a class="headerlink" href="#real-time-shakemaps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>In the U.S.</strong>, ShakeMaps are generated via independent systems running at ANSS
Regional Seismic Systems (RSNs) in Northern California, Southern California, the
Pacific Northwest, Utah, Nevada, and Alaska. For the rest of the U.S., the
ShakeMap group at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC)
produces maps for the regional networks operating in Hawaii, New England, and
the Central and Eastern U.S. on a system referred to as Global ShakeMap (GSM).
The input, metadata, and output files produced by all these instances are
aggregated by the USGS via the Earthquake Program Web system. GSM also provides
backup capabilities for the RSN&#8217;s, but with degraded capabilities; not all data
are flowing from the RSN&#8217;s to GSM automatically.</p>
<p>Separate independent systems running in Puerto Rico and New England generate
ShakeMaps, but these instances do not deliver them through the USGS Earthquake
Program Web pages (at the time of this writing). GSM covers these regions, but
GSM does not yet access the full set of data available to these regional
systems.
More details on regional, national, and international ShakeMap system
implementation and operations are provided in ref:<cite>sec_regionals</cite>).</p>
<p><strong>Internationally</strong>, USGS ShakeMap is installed and is operational in Italy,
France, Portugal, Switzerland, New Zealand, Romania, Indonesia, Iran, Iceland
and several other nations
(see ). Several instances are in testing
or operational mode in the Middle East (including Oman, Morocco, and the UAE; M.

<h3>ShakeMap Atlas<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-atlas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ShakeMap was designed with near-real time earthquake response purposes in mind.
However, many of the strategies for mapping the patterns of peak-ground motions for
real-time applications described above prove useful for recreating the shaking from
historic earthquakes.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap Atlas (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2008"><span>Allen et al., 2008</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2009a"><span>2009a</span></a>) is a self-consistent, well-calibrated
collection of historic earthquakes for which ShakeMaps were systematically generated.
The Atlas constitutes an invaluable online resource for investigating near-source strong
ground-motion, as well as for seismic hazard, scenario, risk, and loss-model
development.</p>

<p>The original (2009) Atlas is a compilation of nearly 5,000 ShakeMaps for the most
significant global earthquakes between 1973 and 2007 (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2008"><span>Allen et al., 2008</span></a>).
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#garcia2012a"><span>Garcia et al. (2012a)</span></a> introduced an update of the Atlas, which extends the time period through 2012,
with a total of 6,100 events. The revised Atlas 2.0 includes: (1) a new version of the
ShakeMap software (V3.5) which improves interpolation and uncertainty estimations; (2)
an updated earthquake source catalogue that includes regional locations and finite fault
models; (3) a refined strategy to select prediction and conversion equations based on a
new seismotectonic regionalization scheme (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#garcia2012b"><span>Garcia et al., 2012b</span></a>); and (4) vastly more
macroseismic intensity and ground-motion data from international agencies.</p>
<p>In order to best replicate shaking that occurred during historic and recent earthquakes we
employ many of the ShakeMap tools described in the previous sections. For many older
events, the important constraints, in addition to the usual site condition map, are (1) the
fault rupture geometry, (2) macroseismic intensity, and (3) peak ground motion data. As
previously described, combining peak ground motions and macroseismic data seamlessly
and rigorously was accomplished with the new interpolation scheme developed by
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2010"><span>Worden et al. (2010)</span></a>. This strategy was in part aimed at most accurately representing
historic earthquake shaking maps, which are often constrained predominantly by key
macroseismic observations, and is essential for the Atlas.</p>

To this end, the Atlas is used for the Earthquake Consequences Database within the Global Earthquake

The &#8220;GEMECD subset&#8221; is a collection of approximately 100 events which constitute

<h3>Earthquake Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#earthquake-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In addition to historical and near-real-time applications, ShakeMap has become widely
used for earthquake mitigation and planning exercises through earthquake scenarios.
Scenarios represent one realization of a potential future earthquake by assuming a
particular magnitude, location, and fault-rupture geometry and estimating shaking using a
variety of strategies (including ShakeMap with GMPEs).
Some of the technical issues related to scenario generation in the <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#technical-guide"><span>Technical Guide</span></a>.
Here we cover the many uses for earthquake scenarios from the users&#8217; perspective.</p>
<p>In planning and coordinating emergency response, utilities, local government, and other
organizations are best served by conducting training exercises based on realistic
earthquake situations-ones similar to those they are most likely to face. ShakeMap
Scenario earthquakes can fill this role. Scenario ShakeMaps can be used to examine
exposure of structures, lifelines, utilities, and transportation corridors to specified
potential earthquakes.</p>
<p>In the September, 2015, Report to NEHRP Agencies from the Advisory Committee on
Earthquake Hazards Reduction (ACHER), recommends:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>USGS Recommendation 4 - ACEHR recommends the USGS expand earthquake scenario development in conjunction with stakeholder engagement in order to examine consequences of earthquakes in high-risk urban areas.</div></blockquote>
<p>To this end, USGS ShakeMap web pages now display many earthquake scenarios and
we are working to develop a comprehensive suite of scenarios for all at-risk
regions in the United States.</p>
<p>A ShakeMap earthquake scenario is simply a ShakeMap with an assumed magnitude and
location, and, optionally, specified fault geometry. For example, <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-13u">Figure  13</a> shows
ShakeMap scenario intensity (top) and peak velocity (bottom) maps for a hypothetical
earthquake of M7.05 on the Hayward Fault in the eastern San Francisco Bay area. Due to
the proximity to populated regions of Oakland, Berkeley and surrounding cities, this
scenario represents one the most destructive earthquakes that could impact the region.
Different renditions of this particular scenario have been widely used for evaluating the
region&#8217;s capacity to respond to such a disaster among Federal, State, utility, business, and
local emergency response organizations.</p>

</div>
<p>The USGS and ANSS partners receive numerous requests for ShakeMap scenarios on an
annual basis. The NEIC Global ShakeMap (GSM) operators have also generated scores
of scenarios for colleagues, partners, other Federal Agencies, non-profit organizations
and other governments around the globe. These and other scenarios are available online
at the ShakeMap Web pages. They are formatted the same as other ShakeMaps, so they
can be easily used in response planning and loss estimation as well as for educational
purposes. They can be found from the Map Archive link at the top of all ShakeMap Web
pages.</p>
<p>ShakeMap earthquake scenarios can be an integral part of earthquake emergency
response planning. ShakeMap scenarios are particularly useful in planning and
exercises when combined with loss estimation systems, such as PAGER, HAZUS and
ShakeCast, which provide ShakeMap-based estimates of overall social and economic
impact, detailed loss estimates, and inspection priorities, respectively. Since
its inception, ShakeMap operators have generated hundreds of earthquake
scenarios that have been used in formal earthquake response exercises around the

<h4>Generating Earthquake Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-earthquake-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Given a selected event, we have developed tools to make it relatively easy to generate a
ShakeMap earthquake scenario. All that is required is to assume a particular fault or fault
segment will (or did) rupture over a certain length and with a chosen magnitude, and to
generate a file describing the fault geometry and another describing the magnitude and
hypocenter of the ostensible earthquake (see the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#software-guide"><span>Software &amp; Implementation Guide</span></a> for details). ShakeMap
can then estimate the ground shaking at all locations over a chosen area surrounding the
fault and produce a full suite of data products just as if event were a real earthquake.
Ground-motions are usually estimated using GMPEs to compute peak ground-motions on
rock conditions; however, the operator may also supply ground motion estimates from
external programs in the form of GMT grid files. As described in <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#amplify-ground-motions"><span>Amplify Ground Motions</span></a>,
ShakeMap corrects the amplitudes based on the local site soil conditions unless
configured otherwise.</p>
<p>At present, ground-motions are estimated using empirical attenuation
relationships (though we can use gridded ground motion estimates from other
sources for those who wish to provide them). We then correct the amplitudes
based on the local site soil (Vs30) conditions as we do in the general ShakeMap
interpolation scheme.  Fault finiteness is included explicitly, basin depth can
be incorporated where appropriate, and source directivity is included via the
relationships developed by Rowshandel (2010).  Depending on the level of
complexity needed for the scenario, event-specific factors, such as variable
slip distribution, could also be incorporated in the amplitude estimates fed to
ShakeMap.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey has evaluated the probabilistic hazard from active
faults in the United States for the National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project.
From these maps it is possible to prioritize the best scenario earthquakes to be
used in planning exercises by considering the most likely candidate earthquake
fault first, followed by the next likely, and so on.  Such an analysis is easily
accomplished by hazard disaggregation, in which the contributions of individual
earthquakes to the total seismic hazard, their probability of occurrence, and
the severity of the ground-motions are ranked.  Using the individual component
earthquakes of these hazard maps, a user can properly select the appropriate
scenarios given their location, regional extent, and specific planning
requirements. As of this writing, we are in the process of generating scenario
maps for all of the events in the current NSHMP hazard maps, and they should be
available on the web site soon. Scenarios are of fundamental interest to
scientific audiences interested in the nature of the ground shaking likely
experienced in past earthquakes as well as the possible effects due to rupture
on known faults in the future.  In addition, more detailed and careful analysis
of the ground-motion time histories (seismograms) produced by such scenario
earthquakes is highly beneficial for earthquake-engineering considerations.
Engineers require site-specific ground-motions for detailed structural response
analysis of existing structures and future structures designed around specified
performance levels.</p>
<p>In most cases, we do not consider the direction of rupture nor do we modify the peak
motions by a directivity term. Fault geometries are specified with a fault file that
represents the fault as one or more planar segments. With this approach, the location of
the earthquake epicenter does not have any effect on the resulting ground-motions; only
the location and dimensions of the fault matter. If we were to add directivity to the
calculations, then different choices of epicentral location could result in significantly
different motions for the same magnitude earthquake and fault segment.</p>
<p>Rather, our approach is to generally show the average effect because it is difficult to justify a
particular choice of hypocenter or to show the results for every possible hypocentral
location. Our empirical predictive approach also only gives average peak ground-motion
values so it does not account for all the expected variability in motions, other than the
aforementioned site amplification variations. Actual ground-motions show significant
variability for a given distance, magnitude, and site condition and, hence, the scenario
ground-motions are more uniform than would be expected for a real earthquake.  The true
variations are partially attributable to 2D and 3D wave propagation, path effects (such as
basin edge amplification and focusing), differences in motions among earthquakes of the
same magnitude, and complex site effects are not accounted for with our methodology.
For scenarios in which we wish to explore directivity explicitly, ShakeMap includes a
tool based on <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#rowshandel2010"><span>Rowshandel (2010)</span></a> as shown in <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-13u">Figure  13</a> and described
in <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#sec-directivity"><span>Directivity</span></a>.</p>
<p>In terms of generating scenarios with the ShakeMap system, a number of specific
considerations and a number of configuration changes are made for scenario events as
opposed to actual events triggered by the network.  For example, after generating a
scenario for a major but hypothetical event, obviously one does not want to automatically
deliver the files to customers who are expecting real events.  To avoid these sorts of
errors, the Event IDs for all scenarios are tagged with the suffix &#8220;_se&#8221;. Such events are
recognized by the processing and delivery software, which is configured to handle the
scenarios as special cases. Scenarios are also given their own separate space on the web
pages. The scenario earthquake ground-motion maps are identical to those made for real earthquakes—with one exception: ShakeMap scenarios are labeled with the word “SCENARIO” prominently displayed to avoid potential confusion with real earthquake occurrences.</p>

<h4>Standardizing Earthquake Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#standardizing-earthquake-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>ShakeMap operators are in the process (during 2015) of developing a full suite of
scenario ShakeMaps from the disaggregated U.S. National Seismic Hazard Map event
catalog produced by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#petersen2014"><span>Petersen et al. (2014)</span></a>. By disaggregating these hazard maps, we will
be able to produce scenarios for substantially all of the credible major earthquakes
believed to threaten the United States. It is hoped that these scenarios will satisfy most of
the requests for scenarios that ShakeMap operators typically receive, and the need for ad
hoc scenarios will be minimized. Each regional seismic network will be ultimately
responsible for producing the scenarios for their region using their local ShakeMap
configuration and the fault and magnitude information provided from the hazard maps.
For areas outside of the regional networks, we will use the Global ShakeMap system to
produce the scenarios. International ShakeMap operators may be able to follow a similar
disaggregation of their own seismic hazard maps to generate a suite of scenarios.</p>

<div class="section" id="applications-of-shakemap">
<h2>Applications of ShakeMap<a class="headerlink" href="#applications-of-shakemap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The distribution of shaking from a significant earthquake, whether expressed as peak acceleration or intensity,
provides responding organizations a significant increment of information beyond magnitude and epicenter.
Real-time ground-shaking maps provide an immediate opportunity to assess the scope and impact of an event.
Thus, they can allow emergency managers and responders to determine what areas were likely subjected
to the highest intensities and what the probable impacts were in those arease. Importantly, ShakeMap also allows
descision-makers a rapid portrayal of those areas that received only weak motions and are likely to be undamaged. The latter areas can be potentially used for mutual aid.</p>
<p>Though initial developed primarily for emergency management, ShakeMaps have been
shown to be highly beneficial for other user sectors. Other uses include:
improved loss estimation, public information and education through the media and
web pages, financial descision-making, and engineering and seismological
research. Some specific examples are provided below for these use cases.</p>
<p>As a side benefit, an intensity-based depiction of shaking hazards through
ShakeMap (and DYFI?) facilitates the adoption of the intensity scale more
generally and can thus it can be used for other risk-reduction systems and
purposes. That is, inculcating the populous to shaking using intensity scales
(as opposed to magnitude alone), has becomes crucial not just for communicating
post-earthquake shaking hazards, the color coding and utilization of intensity
has more generally helped depict imminent and future shaking hazards. For
example, the ShakeMap intensity color-palette has been adopted for Earthquake
Early Warning (EEW; see for example <a class="reference external" href="http://www.shakealert.org/faq/">QuakeAlert</a>) as well as for communicating future hazards
through deterministic scenarios and with Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Maps
(PSHA).</p>

<h3>Emergency Management and Response<a class="headerlink" href="#emergency-management-and-response" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ShakeMap has been recognized as a top priority for disaster management and response in the U.S.:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;ShakeMap has become a valuable tool to assist emergency responders in identifying the likely extent of earthquake damage. Strong-motion data (now increasingly available in real-time) can be correlated with documentation and evaluation of the performance of the built environment, leading to understanding the causes of earthquake damage and the occurrence of good structural and non-structural performance&#8221; (<a class="reference external" href="www.wsspc.org/wp-content/.../PR_14-3_SeismicMonitoring_WebPub.pdf">Western States Seismic Policy Council Policy Recommendation, 14-3,</a>).</div></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, according to a report by the <a class="reference external" href="www.sdr.gov">National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction*</a> (<a class="reference external" href="www.sdr.gov/docs/185820_Earthquake_FINAL.pdf">Grand Challenges for Disaster Reduction: Priority Interagency Earthquake Implementation Actions</a>). The report describes <em>Grand Challenge 1</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Provide hazard and disaster information where and when it is needed. [...] Expand the Advanced National Seismic System to improve seismic monitoring and deliver rapid, robust earthquake information products; For all urban areas with moderate to high seismic risk, produce ShakeMaps that show the variation of shaking intensity within minutes after an earthquake based on near real time data transmission from densely spaced seismic networks.&#8221;</div></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The very rapid availability of earthquake source data—including magnitude,
location, depth, and fault geometry—provides basic orienting information for
emergency responders, essential information for the news media and the public,
and input data for other applications and response-relevant products. Maps of
ground shaking intensity (ShakeMap) have many important applications in
emergency management. Because ShakeMap is available via the Internet, all
emergency responders at all levels of government and the private sector have
access to the same rapidly available information. With this information,
responders can quickly assess the scope of the emergency and mobilize resources
accordingly. Early reconnaissance efforts can target areas known to have been
shaken most severely, and key emergency services including search and rescue,
emergency medical response, safety assessment of critical facilities, and
shelter and mass care can be expedited based on a more rapid identification of
incident location. Monitored information is also useful for rapidly assessing
situations in which a large, widely felt earthquake occurs but causes little
damage (such as the Hector Mine earthquake of October 16, 1999). Clearly, there
are significant economic benefits in scaling a response to the consequences of
an event, including no response for an earthquake that requires none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Based on ground motion data from seismic networks, HAZUS can be used to
generate estimates of economic losses, utility system damage, and population
impacts. These data provide information useful for several response and recovery
actions (discussed in the following section). For response actions, HAZUS
outputs will supplement the ground shaking information from ShakeMap by
estimating the level of damage to buildings, utilities, and transportation
infrastructure; contribute to identifying the appropriate response activation
level; provide guidance for initiating building safety assessments; help
determine the number of shelters that must be opened to house the displaced; and
provide an estimate of the amount of resources needed to care for people in
temporary housing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seismic monitoring and the products that are derived from modern
networks—including ShakeMap and HAZUS—offer significant benefits for emergency
response and recovery. The benefits of enhanced seismic monitoring include rapid
and accurate identification of the event, its location and magnitude, the extent
of strong ground shaking, and estimates of damage and population impacts. This
information expedites hazard identification, promotes rapid mobilization at
levels appropriate to the emergency, and facilitates the rapid identification of
buildings that are safe for continued occupation and those that must be
evacuated. While it may be reasonable to surmise that—in the context of the $100
billion single-event estimate—improved (in particular, more targeted) emergency
response would yield avoided costs in the range of tens of millions of dollars,
there simply is insufficient information to provide a rigorous basis for
quantitative estimate of potential benefits.&#8221;</p>

<p class="last">The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.earthquakeauthority.com/‎">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans) employs ShakeMap
for post-earthquake portfolio assessments for significant California earthquakes. [TBS; REF]</p>
</div>
<p>One of the first examples of the use of ShakeMap for emergency management and response was the
the M7.1 Hector Mine earthquake of October 16, 1999. This event provides an important lesson in the use of
ShakeMap to assess the scope of the event and to determine the level of mobilization necessary.
The Hector Mine earthquake produced ground-motion that was widely felt in
the Los Angeles basin and, at least in the immediate aftermath, required an assessment of potential impacts.
It was rapidly apparent, based on ShakeMap, that the Hector Mine earthquake was not a disaster and despite an
extensive area of strong ground shaking, only a few small desert settlements were affected. Thus,
mobilization of a response effort was limited to a small number of companies
with infrastructure in the region and brief activations of emergency operations centers in
San Bernardino and Riverside Counties and the California Office of Emergency Services
(now the California Emergency Management Agency, or CalEMA), Southern Region.</p>
<p>Unnecessary response in an effort to fully assess the potential effects of an
earthquake, although not as costly as inadequate or misguided response in a real
disaster, can be costly as well. Had the magnitude-7 earthquake occurred in
urban Los Angeles or another urban area in California, ShakeMap could be
employed to quickly identify the communities and jurisdictions requiring
immediate response.  To help facilitate the use of ShakeMap in emergency
response, ShakeMap is now provided to organizations with critical emergency
response functions automatically through USGS web pages, ShakeCast and similar
tools.</p>

<h3>Loss Estimation<a class="headerlink" href="#loss-estimation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fema.org/‎">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) employs ShakeMap for
post-earthquake damage assessments using HAZUS-MH <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#fema2006"><span>FEMA (2006)</span></a> loss estimation software.
USGS generates customized formatted ESRI shapefiles for direct input into the
FEMA’s Hazards U.S. (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fema.gov/hazus">HAZUS-MH</a> ; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#fema2006"><span>FEMA
(2006)</span></a>. The customization includes: specific contour intervals for
all events, geometric mean ground motions (as opposed to ShakeMap standard
maximum component, and peak ground velocity in units of inches/sec rather than
cm/s. The HAZUS-formatted ShakeMaps are made available to FEMA for scenarios and
all significant domestic (U.S.) earthquakes and become automatically available
to FEMA via Web pages and ArcGIS services (see GIS section above).</p>
<p>The use of ShakeMaps as the shaking hazard input into HAZUS is a major improvement in loss-estimation accuracy
because actual ground-motion observations are used directly to assess damage rather than relying on simpler
estimates based on epicenter and magnitude alone, or from predefined earthquake scenarios built into HAZUS software.</p>
<p>FEMA&#8217;s HAZUS loss estimates can be important for coordinating State and Federal
response efforts as well as Disaster Declarations. HAZUS&#8217;s detailed impact
reports can provide focus to the mobilization of resources and
expedite the local, State, and Federal disaster declaration process, thus
initiating the response and
recovery machinery of Government. ShakeMap, when overlaid with inventories of
critical lifelines and
facilities (e.g., hospitals, utilities, and substations, etc.), highways and
bridges, and vulnerable structures,
provides an important means of  prioritizing response. Such response activities
can include: shelter and mass care,
mutual aid assignments, emergency management, damage and safety assessment,
utility and lifeline restoration,
and emergency public information.</p>

</div>
<p>As of 2015, the HAZUS-MH software is run interactively, not automatically, so
qualified FEMA personel must be on hand to initiate HAZUS calculations and post
the results. In addition for heavily-populated areas (major cities in
California, for example), HAZUS software typically can take a few hours to
compute losses. Thus, initial HAZUS-based losses are well behind initial
ShakeMap and PAGER results, and of course they are limited to domestic (U.S.)
earthquakes. However, the HAZUS results provide much greater detail and
information about infrastructure than PAGER-based aggregated losses.</p>
<p>As described in the section on Scenarios, HAZUS-MH is the standard approach for
delivering loss estimates for ShakeMap scenarios domestically. For real events,
the USGS ShakeMap to FEMA HAZUS handoff has been formalized with a formal
liaison agreement (a Memo of Understanding, MOU) involving Doug Bausch, formerly
of FEMA Region VIII, and David Wald at the USGS NEIC. Because ShakeMap shaking
estimates evolve with time, and HAZUS loss estimates take time to compute, it is
essential that direct communications between the two agencies takes place
immediately after a serious earthquake to allow for optimizing the loss
estimates.</p>
<p>The USGS-FEMA partnership has been activated for several domestic earthquakes
since this system was put into place including: 2004 M6.0 Parkfield, California;
2006 Kiholo Bay, Hawaii; 2010 Virginia, 2010 M7.2 Baja California; 2011 M5.6
Oklahoma; 2011 M5.8 Virginia, and the M6.0 2015 American Canyon (South
Napa), Californa, and several other events. The same approach has been
tested and applied retrospectively against the 1994 Northridge and 1989
Loma Pieta, California, and other events.</p>

<div class="section" id="financial-sector-decision-making">
<h3>Financial Sector Decision-Making<a class="headerlink" href="#financial-sector-decision-making" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Post-earthquake financial decision-making has evolved considerably over the past
decade. Insurers and reinsurers, private companies, governments, and aid
organizations have shown increasing creativity in the utilization of
near-real-time earthquake information for their own loss estimation, financial
adjudication, and situational awareness. Such financial analyses can be of
significant benefit to stakeholders, facilitating risk transfer operations,
fostering sensible management of risk portfolios, and assisting disaster
responders. Ultimately, these improvements translate to benefits for the public
and those at risk (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#franco2015"><span>Franco, 2015</span></a>).</p>
<p>In general, there are three categories of post-earthquake financial services and
decision-making: 1) analysis of expected losses arising from an actual event
against a portfolio of exposures, 2) the triggering of payments for parametric
insurance products, and 3) the use of quantitative loss estimates to manage
disaster response and aid. Business and public sector portfolio managers can
employ tools like ShakeCast or in-house applications to automatically retrieve
and compute losses based on pre-assigned fragility curves. Within the
(re)insurance sector, catastrophe (CAT) bonds and contingency loans based on
earthquake risk models are often triggered via parametric analyses which are
dependent on earthquake parameters or intensity-measure (IM) estimates as well
as their uncertainties. Anticipating potential losses and acting rapidly and
accordingly is also of utmost importance to emergency management and disaster
aid communities. Estimated losses constitute vital input for rapid situational
awareness, facilitating decision-making on whether or not to commit and deploy
resources, and to what level.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">USE CASE #5</p>
<p class="last">The Inter-American Development Bank <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iadb.org">http://www.iadb.org</a> (IADB) employs ShakeMap for objective post-earthquake assessments for within 72 hours of  any significant earthquake in Latin America and the Caribbean (LACR). IADB&#8217;s Contingent Credit Facility Loans has set up disaster contingency loans for up to several hundred million USD, conditional on predefined levels of population exposed to ShakeMap intensity VI and higher. Typically, loans can be distributed when the population over intensity VI reaches at least 2% of the population within the coverage area. Loans are available in six LACR countries during the period of availability (J. Martinez, IADB, written communication, 2014).</p>
</div>
<p>To a large extent, the advancement of post-earthquake financial instruments has
been facilitated by the availability of rapid and accurate earthquake parameters
and more quantitative geospatial hazard information. Commensurately, USGS
products like ShakeMap and PAGER have evolved to further accommodate specific
requirements of the financial sector. For instance, improved approaches for
quantifying uncertainty can better inform loss estimates and historical ShakeMap
Atlas data can assist in loss model calibration. In addition, USGS now provides
PAGER loss estimates broken down by country to fulfill the need required in the
CAT bond and contingency loan arena, while still remaining within the confines
of reasonable spatial accuracy. Similarly, requests have been made by U.S. State
governments to further compute losses at the state level, although such
resolution is not yet warranted, particularly in areas of sparse real-time
strong-motion instrumentation. Lastly, for many uses, the automatic retrieval
and processing of ShakeMaps has been facilitated via GeoJSON feeds, web-mapping
servers, and the ShakeCast systems.</p>
<p>Several types of data and information products available or under development
that may be of benefit to the financial sector. The generation of suites of
standardized earthquake scenarios–both domestic and internationally–is underway,
and an update of the global Atlas of ShakeMaps has been completed (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-shakemap-archives"><span>ShakeMap Archives</span></a>).</p>
<p>There are several continuing challenges that are actively under consideration
and scrutiny: implementing directivity, computing and depicting spatial ground
motion correlations, improved approaches for quantifying and conveying
uncertainties, and a more explicit ShakeMap policy and version control
documentation. <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald2016"><span>Wald and Franco (2016)</span></a> describe how these
advances may in turn facilitate the appearance of new and more refined financial

<div class="section" id="public-information-and-education">
<h3>Public Information and Education<a class="headerlink" href="#public-information-and-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The rapid availability of ShakeMap on the Internet combined with the urgent
desire for information following a significant earthquake makes this mapping
tool a huge potential source of public information and education. In instances
in which an earthquake receives significant news coverage, the ShakeMap site as
well as the “Did You Feel It?” (DYFI) system receives an enormous increase in
web site visitors (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald2011c"><span>Wald et al., 2011</span></a>). Such opportunities are
amplified by widespread adoption of ShakeMap into media and educational
materials by other institutions.</p>
<p>ShakeMap&#8217;s intensity scale is key for introducing and inculcating the public and
the media to the importance of macroseismic intensity rather than the continuing
sole dependence on magnitude as the scale of reference for earthquakes. Although
Japanese Meterological Agency (JMA) Intensity (.e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#jma1996"><span>JMA, 1996</span></a>) differs slightly from its U.S. MMI counterpart&#8212;JMA&#8217;s is strictly
instrumentally-derived&#8212;it is widely used and understood in Japan (e.g.,
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#celsi2005"><span>Celsi et al., 2005</span></a>). JMA has successfully made intensity the
norm for communicating to the Japanese population about real-time and future
earthquake hazards via television, smartphone, Web content, annual earthquake
drills, and the educational system. Because JMA intensity is widely understood,
public is be more attuned to earthquake risks than populations familiar only
with magnitude descriptions of earthquakes (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#celsi2005"><span>Celsi et al., 2005</span></a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Earthquake education also occurs through the media. The anchoring effect we
report may be lessened signiﬁcantly if the press consistently used the Mercalli
scale and helped to educate the public about the scale. Research should be
conducted to better understand if and how news organizations can successfully
utilize the Mercalli scale in communicating earthquake information. Alternative
formats, for example, using letters rather than Roman numerals for the
categories, may ameliorate the confusion between magnitude and Mercalli scales.
The experience in Japan provides support for the idea that laypeople can learn
to use the two scales side by side. The Japanese media report both intensities
and magnitude, with viewers maintaining a clearer understanding of the
relationship between magnitude and intensity. In Japan, the overall magnitude
and the intensity are both instrument numbers, with the latter being
location-specific.&#8221;</p>
<p>The inculcation of the public to intensity is inline with the findings of
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#gomberg2013"><span>Gomberg and Jokobitz (2013)</span></a> &#8220;Simpler messaging and
explanations are needed by some users,
and this may be achieved by developing two styles of some products, one designed
for nontechnical users and the other tailored for engineers and scientists. The
tangible impacts of an earthquake must be conveyed more simply and succinctly,
employing a scale useful for decision-making at the regional and local levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acknowledging the importance of ShakeMap as a tool for public information and
education, considerable effort was taken to provide the range of formats
suitable for broadcast and Web pages. Initially, Media Maps, simplified versions
of the Instrumental Intensity maps were packaged in a way that makes them more

information sheet intended to supplement the Media Maps was provided to allow
easier delivery of basic earthquake information. These formats have naturally
evolved to GIS, KML, and now interactive (zoomable) maps that allow
customization of the basemap layers and other content.</p>
<p>However, some of the static maps have made for the most widespread distribution.
A very widely used graphic (<a class="pageref" href="#northridge-nisqually">Figure  16</a>), for example,
compares ShakeMap-generated intensities for the 1994 Northridge earthquake, a
shallow crustal earthquake near Los Angeles, with the 2001, deep, intraslab
Nisqually, WA, earthquake. This figure was reprinted in numerous reports,
textbooks, classes, reports, and briefings including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.earthquakecountry.org/roots/shaking.html">Putting Down Roots</a> and the <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#nrc2006"><span>National

Even though the magnitude of the Nisqually earthquake was slightly larger than the Northridge earthquake, the shaking was lower on average primarily because the fault that ruptured during the Northridge earthquake was shallower (5-20 km deep) than that for the Nisqually earthquake (about 45-50 km deep).</span></p>

<p>For potentially damaging earthquakes, ShakeMap also produces response spectral
acceleration values at three periods
(0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 s) for use not only in loss estimation as mentioned above,
but these IMs also serve many earthquake engineering analysis purposes. In a
post-earthquake environment, information from engineering analyses of structures
(including via ShakeCast, see below) provides a framework for post-earthquake
occupancy and damage inspection by civil engineers.</p>
<p>In addition to providing information on recent events, ShakeMap Web pages
provide maps and aggregate shaking intensity measures (IMs) for numerous
earthquakes, both for recent events (Archives)as well has historic and events
(Atlas).
In the long term&#8212;in conjunction with reported macroseismic data or specific
damage observations&#8212;the parametric IMs provide the basis for analyses of
ground motion observations and human behavior as well as response by both the
natural and built environments. What follows is a short survey of several recent
studies related to these data.</p>
<p>[TBS]</p>
<p>ShakeMap is also a source frequently used by scientists developing Ground Motion
Prediction Equations (GMPEs), Ground Motion/Intensity Conversation Equations
(GMICEs), and other studies where accumulated peak ground motion data are
useful.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/software/shakecast/">ShakeCast</a> is a freely available,
post-earthquake situational awareness application that automatically retrieves

<p>ShakeCast, short for ShakeMap Broadcast, is a fully automated system for
delivering specific ShakeMap products to critical users and for triggering
established post-earthquake response protocols. While ShakeMap was developed
and is used primarily for emergency response, loss estimation, and public
information, for an informed response to a serious earthquake, critical users
must go beyond just looking at ShakeMap, and understand the likely extent and
severity of impact on the facilities for which they are responsible. To this
end the USGS has developed ShakeCast.</p>
<p>ShakeCast allows utilities, transportation agencies, businesses, and other
large organizations to control and optimize the earthquake information they
receive. With ShakeCast, they can automatically determine the shaking value at
their facilities, set thresholds for notification of damage states for each
facility, and then automatically notify (by pager, cell phone, or email)
specified operators and inspectors within their organizations who are
responsible for those particular facilities so they can set priorities for
response.</p>

<p>Another important USGS product that uses ShakeMap output as its primary data
source is <a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/pager/">PAGER</a> (Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response), an
automated system that produces content concerning the impact of significant
earthquakes around the world, informing emergency responders, government and aid
agencies, and the media of the scope of the potential disaster. PAGER rapidly
assesses earthquake impacts by comparing the population exposed to each level of
shaking intensity with models of economic and fatality losses based on past
earthquakes in each country or region of the world. Earthquake alerts – which
were formerly sent based only on event magnitude and location, or population
exposure to shaking – now will also be generated based on the estimated range of
fatalities and economic losses.</p>

in deciding which features in the contour patterns are required by the data.
Ground motions and intensities can vary greatly over small distances, so these

<li>Locations within the same intensity area will not necessarily experience the

the nature of the construction, and the details of the ground motion at that
site. For these reasons, more or less damage than described in the intensity
scale may occur. The ground motion levels and descriptions associated with
each intensity value are based on recent damaging earthquakes. There may be
revisions in these parameters as more data become available or due to further
improvements in methodologies.</li>

<h3>ShakeMap Update Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-update-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">ShakeMaps are preliminary in nature and will be updated as data arrives from a variety of distributed sources. Our practice is to improve the maps as soon as possible, but there are factors beyond our control that can result in delayed updates (see examples below).</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For regions around the world, were there are insufficient near-real time
strong motion seismic stations to generate an adequate, strong-ground-motion
data-controlled ShakeMap, we can still provide a very useful estimate of the
shaking distribution using the ShakeMap software. Site amplification is
approximated from a relationship developed between topographic gradient and
shear-wave velocity. Additional constraints for these predictive maps come
primarily from  additional earthquake source information, particularly fault
rupture dimensions, observed macroseismic intensities (including via the USGS
&#8220;Did You Feel It?&#8221; system, and observed strong ground motions, when and where
available.</li>
<li>There is no formal “final” version of any ShakeMap. Version Control is up to
users. ShakeMap version numbers and time  stamps are provided on the maps, web
pages, and grid files, and metadata.</li>
<li>Our strategy is to update ShakeMaps as warranted from a scientific
perspective. We reserve the option to update ShakeMaps as needed to add data
or to improve scientific merit and/or presentation of the maps in any way
beneficial. This most typical update is after new data arrive, finite-fault
models get established or revised, magnitude gets revised, or as improved site
amplification maps, ground motion prediction equations, or even interpolation
or other procedures become available.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Recent ShakeMap update examples:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>For the very deadly 2008 Wenchuan, China, earthquake, the Chinese strong motion data were not made available for several months.</li>
<li>For the 2011, Tohoku, Japan earthquake, the magnitude was updated from 7.9 to 8.9 over the course of the first hour after origin time. The Japanese strong motion data processing center was impacted by the earthquake yet they provided data for nearly a thousand seismic stations within several days after the earthquake. These vital data were added to the ShakeMap as soon as they became available. .</li>
<li>Due to telemetry limitations, some important seismic station data for the 2014 American Canyon, California, earthquake came in minutes, hours, and as late as four days after that event. The data were added to the ShakeMap soon after they were received and processed. The magnitude also changed from an initial M5.7 to M6.0 and this, too, affected the ShakeMap. Lastly, the causative fault location was added by the Northern California ShakeMap operators several days after the earthquake, modifying the ShakeMap.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Updates to Online Maps</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Real-time ShakeMap Updates</strong>. Changes can be tracked with the ShakeMap
version numbers and time stamps found in the metadata, the <em>info.xml</em> and
<em>grid.xml</em> files, and on the maps themselves (time generated). The info.xml
file contains time stamps, number of stations used, GMPE  information, and
many other attributes that could have changed from version to version.
Often a text statement is provided that notes significant changes for a
particular version.</li>
<li><strong>ShakeMap Atlas Updates</strong>. The ShakeMap Atlas also uses version numbers
for each Atlas event, yet the overall Atlas collections is also Versioned.

the older Atlas (Version 1.0) can be found online on the <a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/">legacy ShakeMap
Archives pages</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario Revisions</strong>. ShakeMap Scenario collections also uses version
numbers for each event, yet the overall scenario collections is also named
according to their source. The latest collection is [TBS]. Currently
ShakeMap Atlas Version 2.0 is online in the USGS <a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/">Comprehensive Catalogue
(ComCat) Earthquake database</a>, Some archival (older)
scenarios are online on the <a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/">legacy ShakeMap Archives pages</a>. Scenario ShakeMaps
will be revised when the underlying problabilistic seismic map fault
