Many contributions in a variety of forms have greatly helped in the development,
implementation, and use of ShakeMap. ShakeMap is just one  end
product of a very sophisticated seismic network. Credit is given to all involved
with the regional and national networks in the United States working under the
auspices of the USGS Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).

Much of the early conceptual development of ShakeMap benefited greatly from
discussions with Professors Kanamori and Heaton at Caltech. Both the TriNet
Steering and Advisory Committees also provided ongoing oversight and feedback in
the early years of TriNet. Discussions with many colleagues, including W.
Savage, K. Campbell, R. Nigbor, and M. Petersen, provided additional guidance.
Early trips to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), and in particular
discussions with K. Doi, were also  helpful.

Early ShakeMap web pages survived substantial traffic spikes due to the
ingenuity and vigilance of S. Schwarz (USGS, Pasadena). Many aesthetic improvements
and integration of the ShakeMap Web pages into the USGS Earthquake Hazards Team
Web Page standard templates were guided by L. Wald (USGS, Golden). Later
implementations were greatly improved by the Haz-Dev Web Team, particularly by
J. Fee and E. Martinez.

C. Scrivner, then at the CA Dept of Mines & Geology (CDMG),
contributed greatly to the initial ShakeMap software development. P.
Lombard (U.C. Berkeley) contributed to several important aspects
of ShakeMap code development and Q/A, including developing *plot_reg*.

Global ShakeMap (GSM) is run out of NEIC, Golden, CO, and is operated
primarily by C.B. Worden, K. Lin, K. Marano,
E. Thompson, V. Quitoriano, and D. Wald.

At regional network centers, K. Pankow (University of Utah), S. Malone
(University of Washington), K. Lin (formerly CGS, now USGS, Golden),
D. Dreger, P. Lombard (U.C. Berkeley), and L. Gee (USGS, Menlo Park),
E. Hauksson (Caltech), G. Biasi (Univ Nevada, Reno), and
H. Bundock (ret.), T. MacDonald, D.Oppenheimer, and J. Boatwright
(USGS, Menlo Park) all played a critical role in testing, providing
feedback, and improving the ShakeMap system. In addition, a number of other
people assisted the above colleagues in the regional ShakeMap implementation and
operation.

We received extremely important feedback regarding the user interface from
participants through a number of meetings and workshops in CA for
scientific and engineering perspectives, as well as for a very wide variety of
usersâ€™ perspectives. These workshops were organized by J. Goltz and M.
Vinci. In addition, ongoing feedback has always been abundant and provides
critical advice and ideas that seeds ongoing, iterative improvements to the
ShakeMap system.

Over the years, numerous student researchers contributed greatly to the operation,
development, user support and many other aspects of ShakeMap, particularly
developing the ShakeMap Atlas. The students include undergraduates, C. Gustafson,
P. Geimer, A. Hotovec, K. Johnson, R. Johnson, R. Mah, T. Slota;
graduate students L. Seidman, S Verros, L. McWhirter;
and post-doctoral fellows T. Allen and D. Garcia.

International collaborators include A. Michelini, and L. Faenza (INGV,
Rome) and C. Cauzzi (ETH Zurich). ShakeMap Workshops help at U.C. Berkeley
and at the Erice, Sicily, Summer School were very helpful in improving ShakeMap
implementations around the country and around the world.

D. Bausch, (formerly FEMA) played a vital role in standardizing HAZUS loss
estimates using ShakeMap input, responding to numerous national earthquake
responses, and promoting the use of ShakeMap among the earthquake
response and planning communities. In interfacing with HAZUS software
and loss estimates, contributions from J. Bouabid at
Durham Technology, and C. Kircher of Charlie Kircher Assoc were key.

USGS colleagues V. Quitoriano and K. Lin have long operated,
supported, and greatly added to the development of ShakeMap. M. Hearne and
K. Marano of the PAGER team have also provided support for ShakeMap. E. Thompson
has contributed greatly to the development of scenarios and advancing ShakeMap
science. K. Jaiswal, N. Field, N. Luco, M. Petersen have all been very helpful
in software calibration and validation and overall advice.

Lastly, we are also extremely grateful for the recognition of the
importance of ShakeMap and the ongoing internal and external support for its
development at all levels within the USGS. Along the way, the support of
J. Filson, D. Applegate, B. Leith, H. Benz, C. Wolfe, W. Savage, J.
McCarthy, and many others has been critical.

ShakeMap relies extensively on the Generic Mapping Tools
(:ref:`Wessel and Smith, 1995 <gmt_ref>`).

Thank you, all.
